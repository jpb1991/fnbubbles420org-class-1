# Money Calculation Program

This is a simple Python program that calculates the remaining money after considering total funds, work money, spending, and utility expenses.

## Overview

The program takes the following financial data:

- `total_money`: The total amount of money available.
- `work_money`: Additional funds earned from work.
- `spending_money`: The amount of money spent.
- `utility_money`: The money spent on utility bills.

It then calculates the leftover money by adding `total_money` and `work_money`, and subtracting `spending_money` and `utility_money`.

Finally, it outputs the amount of money that is left over, formatted to two decimal places.

## Code

```python
total_money = 400.25
work_money = 300.14
spending_money = 29.99
utility_money = 100.20

leftover_money = total_money + work_money - spending_money - utility_money

print("${:.2f} is how much money that is left over.".format(leftover_money))
```
How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If you don't, you can download and install it from here.

2. Save the code in a Python file (e.g., budgetcalculator.py).

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the Python file is saved.

4. Run the script using the following command:

bash
Copy
python budgetcalculator.py
The output will display the amount of money left over in the format:
